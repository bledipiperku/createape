# CreateApe React Native Challenge Application

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running.

## Setup environments

```
yarn setup
```

### Starting project

After the environment setup start the application with those scripts:

### iOS

```
yarn ios
```
This should take a couple of minutes to complete, but an iPhone simulator should open up, and the app should automatically start up

### Android

```
yarn android
```

This should take a couple of minutes to complete, but an Android emulator should open up, and the app should automatically start up
